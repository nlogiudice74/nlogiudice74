- 👋 Hi, my name is Nick LoGiudice. This is my first year as a Computer Science major, and I am hoping to eventually graduate with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use various languages and tools to make myself a successful software developer in an increasingly technology-dependent world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of the python language, the basics of computer hardware and system software, and the basic concepts of systems analysis and design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects based on python to further my understanding of the language.
- 📫 How to reach me: nlogiudice2092@gmail.com
